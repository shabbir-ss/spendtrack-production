# 🚀 SpendTrack - Deployment Instructions

## ✅ **PRODUCTION ORGANIZATION COMPLETE!**

Your SpendTrack application has been successfully organized and committed to Git with **ONLY production files**.

---

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### 1. **Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `spendtrack-production` (or any name you prefer)
3. Make it **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. **Connect Local Repository to GitHub**

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spendtrack-production.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. **Deploy to Railway**

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your `spendtrack-production` repository**

### 4. **Add PostgreSQL Database**

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. **Click "New Service"**
3. **Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway will automatically create `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 5. **Set Environment Variables**

In Railway project settings → Variables, add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=d3c6a1def68b6fb51ecd11298f2884b4d4710f3ef8704f3794b212413b9a69d6
JWT_SECRET=4a6d90c119cd5dd7eabe73f727c50e1ead1d5017bcdc92ce9cb6566080c1f0cb
```

### 6. **Deploy!**

Railway will automatically:

- ✅ Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- ✅ Run build (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Run database migrations (`npm run postbuild`)
- ✅ Start your application (`npm start`)

---

## 🎯 **WHAT'S DEPLOYED**

### ✅ **Production Files Only:**
